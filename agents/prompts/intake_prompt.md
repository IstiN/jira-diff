Your task is intake analysis. Read all files in the 'input' folder:
- The ticket description is in request.md — this is a raw idea or informal input
- Read existing_epics.json to understand what Epics already exist in the JD project
- Read existing_stories.json to understand what Stories already exist — avoid creating duplicates
- If you need full details of any existing story, run: dmtools jira_get_ticket JD-X

Analyse the request, break it into structured Jira tickets (Epics or Stories), then:
1. Write individual description files to outputs/stories/ (story-1.md, story-2.md, ...)
2. Write outputs/stories.json with the ticket plan
3. Write outputs/comment.md with your intake analysis summary

Follow all instructions from the input folder exactly.
